# Tobi-PetManagementSystem
Final year project worked for B.Tech Degree in our last year.


This was a pet management system built out of a hobby for the pet Tobi, who we had as flatmates.
Main objective was to view and carry out pet functions when we were not present at home.

Functions are as follows:
1. Live camera feed (Flask, TinkerBoard S)
2. Distress detection on basis of visual. (OpenCV, TinkerBoard S)
3. Scheduled or manual automated feeding - breed specific (MERN Stack with Firebase DB) 
4. Veterinary contact control and appointment reminders (MERN Stack with Firebase DB)
5. Pet advise chatBOT (Google DialogFlow)
6. Vaccination and medicinal reminders (WebApp and Firebase DB) 
7. Food re-supply reminders and scheduling (WebApp and Firebase DB)

The entire system can be hosted with Google Cloud Platform at its heart, and module connectivity via internet.
For project demo, the system was hosted locally on a local network and the code is set in par to that.
