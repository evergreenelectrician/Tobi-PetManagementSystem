# Tobi-PetManagementSystem
Final year project worked for B.Tech Degree in our last year.


This was a pet management system built out of a hobby for the pet Tobi, who we had as flatmates.
Main objective was to view and carry out pet functions when we were not present at home.

Functions are as follows:
1. Live camera feed
2. Distress detection on basis of visual and sound detection
3. Scheduled or manual automated feeding - breed specific
4. Veterinary contact control and appointment reminders
5. Pet advise chatBOT (optional)
6. Vaccination and medicinal reminders
7. Food re-supply reminders and scheduling
